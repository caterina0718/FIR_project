# FIR_project

These days, the volume of textual data is increasing, and the challenge of retrieving the expected information becomes harder than ever. Moreover, because of its popularity - every one of us uses Information Systems every day (\textit{e.g. Google}) - we need some methods to perform this task more smartly. That is why ML-based solutions are needed to automate the job and to make the information retrieval (IR) process easier and more efficient for people.

This entails the need to reliably compare their capabilities, in order to determine a net superior choice of search model, given a set of data. This is often done by means of statistical methods (i.e. significance tests), which show with great accuracy whether two (or more) sets of data are significantly different. 

The present project contains a Jupyter notebook with all all the code used for the statistical comparison of two IR models (Word2Vec and Boolean) and the corresponding TREC runs, performed using the mentioned models.

#Dataset
The project makes uses of the TREC Genomics dataset, which has NOT been included.
